### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This submission is completed by George Dai for the third course in John
Hopkins University's Coursera Data Science Specialty series. This project is
for running analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

### Dataset

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Files

* **Readme.md** This file

* **CodeBoo.md** A file that describes the variables, data, and any work or 
  transformations that are used to process the data

* **run_analysis.R** This is the program to perform data cleaning work assigned
  with the following 5 required steps:

        o Merges the training and test datasets into a combined set
        o Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
          each measurement
        o Uses descriptive activity names instead of codes in the dataset
        o Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive vairable names
        o From the above set, create a second, independent tidy dataset with
          the average of each variable for each activity and subject
          
* **finalset.txt** This is the final output file from the above steps
